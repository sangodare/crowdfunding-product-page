### Built with HTML CSS and JavaScript

The solution to the challenge was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I made sure the solution i built is a close match  to the design provided by Frontend Mentor. I made use of semantic HTML5 markup such as nav, button, header, section and so on. flexbox and CSS GRID came in handy for the layout. An additonal feature was added, the data on the progress made is stored in the local storage so that when a user reloads or revisits the page, any update to the progress made will take into account the data from the previous page visits. 

### What I learned

I learnt how to create accessible mobile menu using the appropriate aria-labels such as aria-controls and aria-expanded, assign roles to elements e.g the element that controls the menu has role 'button' while the element that contains the menu has role 'menu'.

Also learnt about positoning elements in CSS, how it affects the layout e.g using 'position: absolute' on a transformed element can cause overflow which can lead to horizontal scrolling.

Also learnt that background images in CSS are not accessible.

Moving forward, accessibility will be at the forefront of any project i build, my goal is to use more semantic HTML and  learn more about accessibility, so as to ensure anything i build is accessible.
